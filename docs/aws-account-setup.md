## Disadvantages of Using Root Email to Access Management Console

- **Security Risk:** The root account has full access to all AWS resources, making it a prime target for attacks.
- **No Fine-Grained Control:** You cannot apply policies or restrictions to the root account, unlike IAM users.
- **Audit Challenges:** Activities performed with the root account are harder to audit and monitor.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you've successfully created and secured your AWS account. Remember to use the IAM user for daily tasks and keep your root account credentials safe. You're now ready to explore and leverage AWS for your projects.
